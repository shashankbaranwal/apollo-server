# Apollo-server

### What is Apollo?

- The Apollo platform is an implementation of GraphQL that can transfer data b/w the cloud (server) to the UI of your app.
- Apollo Build it's environment that can use it to handle GraphQL on the client as well as the server side of the application.

### What is GraphQL?
- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
- graphql is the library used to build a GraphQL schema and execute queries against it.
- GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API.
- GraphQL gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. 
- GraphQL makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
 
### Describe your data           

type Project {                
  name: String
  tagline: String
  contributors: [User] 
} 

### Ask for what you want

{
  project(name: "GraphQL") {
    tagline
  }
}

### Get predictable results

{
  "project": {
    "tagline": "A query language for APIs"
  }
}


### Difference between GraphQL and Rest?

REST APIs
- A REST API is an architectural concept for network-based software.
- REST has been used to make new APIs.
- Synchronous communications through HTTP only.
- REST follows server-driven architechture.
- Over Fetching or under fetching data resources.

GraphQL
- GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language, a specification, and a set of tools that operates over a single endpoint using HTTP.
- GraphQL has been to optimize for performance and flexibility.
- Synchronous/Asynchronous communication in multiple protocols such as HTTP,AMQP,MQTT.
- GraphQL follows server-driven architechture.
- We only get what we ask for by querying to get data for our exact needs.




### Write down about Schema and Resolvers?

Resolvers
- When using graphql-tools, you define your field resolvers separately from the schema. Since the schema already describes all of the fields, arguments, and result types, the only thing left is a collection of functions that are called to actually execute these fields.
Keep in mind that GraphQL resolvers can return promises. In fact, most resolvers that do real work - for example fetching data from a database or a REST API - will return a promise.

Schema
- A schema is only useful if our data graph conforms to the schema's structure. Enforcing a schema's structure is one of the core features of Apollo Server, a production-ready, open-source library that helps you implement your data graph's API.
